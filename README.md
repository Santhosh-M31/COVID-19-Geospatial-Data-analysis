# COVID-19-Geospatial-Data-analysis

The COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting social distancing recommendations and related restrictions have led to numerous short-term changes in economic and social activity around the world, all of which may have impacts on our environment. Your challenge is to use space-based data combined with ground observations and document all the environmental changes caused by COVID-19 and the associated societal responses. 

For example, a decline in air pollution and other emissions may be linked to reduced transportation, commuting needs, and reduction in industrial activities. Also, studies reveal a reduction in air pollution in areas with reduced economic activity. 

Your goal is to use space-based satellite data combined with ground observations like air pollution, social-economic activity, traffic or transportation, mobility, industrial activity perform exploratory data analysis, find a correlation between changes in ground activities and their impact on the environment. Compare data across different time periods and geographic regions and explore changes in Earth-related attributes (such as land use, land cover, and other characteristics) in response to COVID-19?
